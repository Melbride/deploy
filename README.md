# deploy
This repository contains a Customer Churn prediction model that I created using Random Forest algorithm to predict whether the customer will churn or not.
There are also two files app.py and Streamlit_App.py that I created to deploy the model using flask and streamlit respectively.
To deploy using flask run app.py in the command prompt to view the model under localhost and for streamlit use streamlit run Streamlit_App.py to also deploy using streamlit.
